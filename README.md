# Nest and TypeScript CRUD Rest API

Created a basic user CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API to practice my backend skills.

Technologies used: Node, TypeScript, Nest, TypeORM, PostgresSQL and Docker.

## Running Locally

1. Ensure the docker daemon is running
2. Run `docker-compose up` from the root directory
